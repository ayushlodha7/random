Based on the detailed case presentation, Alicia exhibits several symptoms that align with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), predominantly the inattentive presentation. Here’s how you might formulate the diagnosis:

### Diagnosis: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Presentation (DSM-5 314.00)

#### Supporting Information:
1. **Inattention:**
   - Alicia has been noted to have significant challenges with attention, as evidenced by her history of "seeming not to listen," difficulties with concentration, and "wandering about" since kindergarten. Her current teachers and parents observe these ongoing issues.
   - She demonstrates a high level of variability in school performance, particularly struggling with subjects that require sustained mental effort, like reading.
   - Her inattention is further supported by consistent scoring across multiple informants (parents and teachers) on the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham—IV Questionnaire (SNAP-IV), which indicates positive ratings for seven to nine of the nine DSM-5 symptoms of inattention.

2. **Limited Hyperactivity/Impulsivity:**
   - Alicia shows minimal signs of hyperactivity or impulsivity, with scores indicating zero to two of the nine DSM-5 symptoms in these categories.

3. **Impact on Social Interactions and Academic Performance:**
   - Socially, Alicia is described as a loner, often disengaged during group activities and not maintaining friendships, possibly due to her inability to stay focused.
   - Academically, she faces significant struggles, which are compounded by her inattention and have led to a range of performance from satisfactory to poor.

4. **Developmental and Medical History:**
   - Alicia’s early development and medical history, including mild speech delays and ear infections, do not fully account for her current symptoms, suggesting that her difficulties are not solely attributable to these developmental issues.

5. **Family and Environmental Factors:**
   - There is a family history of ADHD and other psychiatric conditions, which might suggest a genetic predisposition to attentional deficits.

#### Recommendations:
- Comprehensive evaluation by a child psychologist or psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential comorbid conditions.
- Consideration of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) at school to support her educational needs.
- Behavioral and educational interventions, potentially supplemented by medication, should be explored to manage symptoms effectively.
- Parental guidance on effective communication and discipline strategies to improve interactions and reduce conflict.

This formulation considers Alicia's symptomatology, the impact on her functioning, and the information from multiple sources to support the diagnosis of ADHD, predominantly inattentive presentation.
